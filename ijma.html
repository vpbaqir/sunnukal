  <h1>Ijma`: The Concept of Consensus in Islam</h1>
  
  <p>Ijma` (Arabic: إجماع) refers to the consensus of the Islamic Ummah (community) on a particular issue, and it is considered a significant source of Islamic law.</p>
  
  <h2>Evidence for Ijma`</h2>
  <p>One of the foundational pieces of evidence is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says:</p>
  <div class="verse">
    “Thus We have made you (Muslims), a Wasat (just) (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind” [al-Baqarah 2:143].
  </div>
  <p>The phrase “witnesses over mankind” implies that the Ummah is responsible for testifying about the deeds of others and judging them. If the Ummah unanimously agrees on something, it must be either true or false. If it is true, it serves as proof. If it is false, then it is improbable that this Ummah, which is beloved to Allah since the time of its Prophet until the onset of the Hour, could agree on something false.</p>
  
  <h2>Types of Ijma`</h2>
  <p>Ijma` can be classified into two types:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Definitive Ijma`:</strong> This type is well established, such as the consensus that the five daily prayers are obligatory and that zina (fornication, adultery) is haram. No one can deny this type of ijma`, and rejecting it is a sign of disbelief unless one is genuinely ignorant.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Presumptive Ijma`:</strong> This type is known only through research and study, where scholars may differ regarding the existence of ijma` on a particular issue. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah noted that the ijma` accepted is that of the righteous early generations (as-salaf as-salih) due to the disagreements that arose later.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Conditions of Ijma`</h2>
  <p>There are certain conditions for establishing ijma`:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It must be soundly proven, either through well-known consensus among scholars or transmitted by trustworthy narrators.</li>
    <li>It should not have been preceded by a well-known difference of opinion; otherwise, it cannot be considered ijma`.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is important to note that ijma` does not invalidate previous differences of opinion but rather prevents new ones from arising.</p>

  <h3>Establishment of Ijma`</h3>
  <p>Ijma` is established as soon as scholars of a particular era agree on an issue, and it is not necessary for those who reached the consensus to have passed away. If a mujtahid (scholar) takes a position and it becomes well-known without objection from others, it can be considered ijma`. Silence from scholars until death can also indicate ijma`.</p>
  
  <p>As stated in Al-Usul min ‘Ilm al-Usul (62-64), if there is an apparent consensus that contradicts a clear and authentic text, one must investigate the evidence's clarity, authenticity, or whether it has been abrogated.</p>

    <h1>The Quran and Hadith</h1>

    <h2>The Quran</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition and Importance:</strong> The Quran is the most sacred text in Islam, believed to be the direct word of God revealed to the Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century CE. It was revealed in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly near Mecca.</p>

    <p><strong>Spelling and Recitation:</strong> The Quran is sometimes spelled as "Koran." The Prophet Muhammad recited the Quran exactly as he received it, allowing for its memorization and oral transmission.</p>

    <p><strong>Memorization and Study:</strong> Memorization of the Quran is known as <em>Hifz</em>, while the study of its pronunciation is called <em>Tajweed</em>. Tajweed focuses on correct pronunciation and context.</p>

    <p><strong>Contents and Structure:</strong> The Quran contains 114 chapters (surahs) and over 6,000 verses (ayahs), organized from longest to shortest rather than chronologically. Written in classical Arabic, it is read from right to left and is regarded as the "Well-Preserved Book."</p>

    <p><strong>Core Message:</strong> The primary message of the Quran is the oneness of Allah (God). It serves as a guide for ethical living, emphasizing respect, dignity, and humility. The Quran recounts the stories of several prophets and includes laws related to inheritance and the rights and responsibilities of individuals.</p>

    <p><strong>Relation to Sharia Law:</strong> Many Muslim countries incorporate <em>Sharia</em> (Islamic Law) into their legal systems, blending traditional Islamic jurisprudence with civil statutes.</p>

    <h2>The Hadith</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition and Role:</strong> The Hadith is a collection of traditions and sayings about the Prophet Muhammad, serving as a significant source of Sharia law and moral guidance, second only to the Quran.</p>

    <p><strong>Collections:</strong> There are six major collections of Hadith, with <em>Sahih Al Bukhari</em> and <em>Sahih Muslim</em> being the most respected. The other four include <em>Sunan At Tirmidhi</em>, <em>Sunan Abu Dawud</em>, <em>Sunan an-Nasai</em>, and <em>Sunan Ibn Majah</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>Transmission:</strong> The Hadith texts were transmitted orally before being written down and compiled in the 8th and 9th centuries, more than 100 years after the Prophet's death. There is a network of narrators known as <em>isnad</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Islamic scholars scrutinize Hadiths, ranking them as authentic, acceptable, weak, or fabricated based on the character of the narrators and their reliability.</p>
