  <h1>The Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)</h1>
  <p>The edifice of Islam is built upon the basic belief that ‘there is no god save Allah, and Muhammad is His apostle’. It is a statement that is whispered into the ears of every newborn and the dying and uttered on all possible occasions by Muslims all over the world. It is part of the call for prayers five times a day.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Allama Iqbal, thinker and poet, sings the glories of the Prophet in the following words:</p>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>‘Tis in the forests and the hills,<br>
      And on the tranquil plains,<br>
      On the seas, in the arms of the waves,<br>
      In the roar of hurricanes;<br>
      A music heard in China’s towns,<br>
      Morocco’s desert song,<br>
      And hid within each Muslim’s heart<br>
      It makes his faith grow strong<br>
      How I have made this glorious name<br>
      Beyond all thought sublime.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The Prophet was not a learned man. Indeed, there is no evidence that Allah chose His prophets from among the learned. It does not mean he was illiterate, as is frequently said about him. The Prophet, if he was illiterate, could not have engaged in the transaction of business and managed caravans. The Prophet admonished every Muslim to seek knowledge even if it meant having to go to China. It is hardly unlikely that he did not practice what he preached.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>The Quran's message:</strong> Allah did not send the Quran to be understood by the learned only. A book that is sent for the guidance of all mankind cannot be the preserve of the few. The message of the Quran requires no priesthood for its intermediation.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Prophet Muhammad did not claim to have the healing touch of Jesus nor turn water into wine as Jesus did; nor did he have the magic staff of Moses. He worked no miracles. In his own words, the greatest miracle he brought with him was the Quran.</p>

  <p>The message of Islam is one of mercy and compassion, centered around the belief in one God, and focused on social justice, peace, and human dignity.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>Farewell Message:</strong> "All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor does a white over a black, except by piety and good action."</p>
