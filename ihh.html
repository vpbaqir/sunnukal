  <h1>Qadar: The Concept of Divine Destiny</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Qadar</strong> (Arabic: قدر) refers to the concept of divine destiny in Islam, encompassing the idea that Allah has decreed everything that happens in the universe according to His prior knowledge and wisdom.</p>
  
  <p>Belief in al-Qadar includes four key elements:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>The belief that Allah knows all things:</strong> Allah's knowledge encompasses everything from eternity to eternity, including His actions and the actions of His creations. 
      <p>Allah says: <em>“Know you not that Allah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth? Verily, it is (all) in the Book (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz). Verily, that is easy for Allah.”</em> [al-Hajj 22:70]</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>The belief that Allah has written decrees:</strong> Allah has recorded everything in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz (the Book of Decrees). 
      <p>As narrated in Sahih Muslim (2653): “Allah wrote down the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.”</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The belief in the will of Allah:</strong> Everything that happens is by the will of Allah, whether concerning His actions or those of His creations. 
      <p>Allah states: <em>“And your Lord creates whatsoever He wills and chooses.”</em> [al-Qasas 28:68]</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>The belief that all things are created by Allah:</strong> Everything that occurs is created by Allah, including its essence, attributes, and movements. 
      <p>As mentioned: <em>“To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight. And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allah wills...”</em> [al-Takwir 81:28-29]</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The entire universe is under the dominion of Allah, and nothing can happen without His knowledge and will. And Allah knows best.</p>
