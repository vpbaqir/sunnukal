        <h1>The Infallibility (Ismah) of Prophets in Ahlussunnah</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Infallibility, known as Ismah, is a crucial concept in the Ahlussunnah understanding of prophethood. It asserts that prophets are free from sin and error in their mission to deliver Allah’s revelation.</p>

        <h2>Meaning of Ismah</h2>
        <p>Ismah in the Ahlussunnah view refers to divine protection granted to prophets to prevent them from committing deliberate sins, especially in their role as messengers. This protection ensures the purity and reliability of the message they deliver. However, this does not imply that prophets are free from all human experiences like sickness, forgetfulness, or fatigue. The focus is on their integrity and accuracy in conveying divine instructions.</p>

        <h2>Types of Infallibility</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Major Infallibility:</strong> Prophets are safeguarded from major sins (Kabair) and grave moral failings. This is essential to maintain their credibility as role models for the community.</li>
            <li><strong>Minor Infallibility:</strong> Prophets may experience minor errors, such as forgetfulness in daily matters, but these do not affect their mission or status as prophets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Significance in Ahlussunnah</h2>
        <p>For Ahlussunnah, Ismah reinforces the trust believers have in prophetic teachings. It guarantees that no prophet will distort Allah’s message, intentionally or unintentionally. As a result, their words and actions are considered authoritative and serve as an ultimate guide for Muslims in their practice of Islam.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The concept of infallibility is vital to upholding the integrity of prophethood. In Ahlussunnah belief, the protection provided to prophets ensures that their message is preserved accurately, guiding future generations toward the truth of Islam.</p>
