  <h1>Tawhid: The Oneness of God</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Tawhid</strong>, or <strong>Tawheed</strong>, is an Islamic term that refers to the oneness of God. It is the fundamental belief in Islam that there is only one God, who is indivisible and unique. Tawhid signifies the belief in the absolute oneness and uniqueness of God, and it forms the central aspect of a Muslim's religious belief.</p>
  
  <div class="highlight">
    <p>The word 'tawhid' (توحيد) is derived from the Arabic root 'wahhada' (واحدة), meaning "to unite" or "to make one." This concept reflects the struggle of monotheism against polytheism and is deeply rooted in the Muslim understanding of God as the sole Creator and Sustainer of the universe.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Islamic teachings assert that God is indivisibly one (<i>ahad</i>) and single (<i>wahid</i>). This belief is expressed in the first part of the Islamic declaration of faith, or <strong>shahada</strong>, which affirms the oneness of God. The Quran unequivocally condemns attributing divinity to anything or anyone besides God, a practice known as <strong>shirk</strong>, which is considered an unforgivable sin unless repented for.</p>

  <div class="verse">
    <h2>Chapter 112: Al-Ikhlas</h2>
    <p>
      Say, "He is Allah—One; <br>
      Allah—the Sustainer. <br>
      He has never had offspring, nor was He born. <br>
      And there is none comparable to Him."
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>According to Islamic tradition, Tawhid is not merely a theological concept but the cornerstone of a Muslim's life. It underscores the uniqueness and transcendence of God, emphasizing that He is not confined by the material world and is beyond comparison. This nondualistic belief distinguishes Islam from other major religions.</p>
  
  <p>The entirety of Islamic teachings is founded on the principle of Tawhid. From theology to jurisprudence, philosophy, and Sufism, the core of Islamic thought revolves around understanding and professing this oneness. Different generations of Islamic scholars have interpreted Tawhid in various ways, contributing to the rich intellectual history of Islam.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p>The Quran teaches the existence of a single, absolute truth that transcends the world. God is portrayed as an independent and indivisible being, and all creation depends on Him. He is not bound by space or time, and His power and knowledge are beyond human comprehension.</p>
